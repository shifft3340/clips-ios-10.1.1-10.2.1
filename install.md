How to install 'Clips' in iOS 10.1.1 or iOS 10.2
Yesterday Apple released ' Clips ', an application for editing and sharing videos on social networks that only works on iOS 10.3 , the latest iOS update released to date.

Well, if you want to make use of the application but you have not updated to iOS 10.3 not to lose the jailbreak you are in luck, since then I'll explain how to do it in iOS 10.1.1 or iOS 10.2.
Requirements

    An iPhone or iPad that has iOS 10.1.1 or iOS 10.2.
    Download 'Clips' on your computer through iTunes.
    Install AppSync Unified from Cydia.
    Any tool that allows the installation of .ipa files on an iPhone or iPad. 

Step-by-step tutorial

    Once you have completed the previous steps, access from your computer to the path where the .ipa Clips file is located.
    It renames "Clips 1.0.ipa" to "Clips 1.0.zip".
    Extract the folder from the .zip file and access "Payload -> Right button in Clips.app, click" Show package contents ". (In Windows, just open the "Clips app" folder).
    Edit the Info.plist file with any text editor, locate the <key> MinimumOSVersion </ key> command and change <string> 10.3 </ string> to <string> 10.1.1 </ string> or <string> 10.2 < / String> depending on your version. 

    Once changed, return to the main folder (where the four initial files are located), select them and choose "compress 4 files". 

    At this point, simply change the name of the .zip file that will have been created in that same directory to "Clips-mod.ipa".
    Finally, use any tool that allows the installation of .ipa files on your iPhone or iPad to enjoy Clips without upgrading to iOS 10.3. 

You see, the process is quite simple, and it will only take you a couple of minutes to have your copy of Clips modified ready to install depending on the version of iOS with which you count, so if you want to make use of it, do not hesitate to Follow the tutorial.

Note : To install it, you can use the "iFunbox" tool, available for both MacOS and Windows .
